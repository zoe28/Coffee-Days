I made this Yelp-clone for coffee shops as my final project for the Hackbright bootcamp.

## Design

I used:

- Next.js for the frontend
- React-Bulma for the component library
- Flask + SQLAlchemy for the API

## Cool features

- Try dragging the map to update your location search
- Leave a review for your favorite coffee shops
